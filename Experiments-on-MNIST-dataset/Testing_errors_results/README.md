This folder contains the testing classification errors from running CNN_vs_shrinkage_CNN.py. 

The first letter indicates whether it is from a original CNN or a shrinkage CNN. 
The second letter indicates the type of the noise and the third one is the noise level. 

For example, S_s_2.txt contains the results from the testing errors from shrinkage CNN, salt noise with 0.2 level.
